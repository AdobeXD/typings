 * [RepeatGrid on Adobe.io](https://www.adobe.io/xd/uxp/develop/reference/RepeatGrid/)
 *
 * Repeat Grid container node containing multiple grid cells, each one a child Group. Changes within one cell are automatically synced to all the other cells - with certain exceptions, called "overrides." A Repeat Grid also defines a rectangular clipping mask which determines how may cells are visible (new cells are automatically generated as needed if the Repeat Grid is resized larger).
 * Each grid cell is a Group that is an immediate child of the RepeatGrid. These groups are automatically created and destroyed as needed when the RepeatGrid is resized.
 * It is not currently possible for plugins to create a new RepeatGrid node, aside from using commands.duplicate to clone existing RepeatGrids.
