 * The `interactions` module and related APIs provide _read only_ information about the document's interactive prototype mode, including:
 *
 * * The blue "wires" seen in XD's prototyping UI, known as "interactions," which specify gestures/events which trigger actions to
 occur in the prototype. Accessible as a single consolidated global listing via this module's [`allInteractions`](#module_interactions-allInteractions) API,
 or you can access information from specific nodes in the scenegraph via [`SceneNode.triggeredInteractions`](./scenegraph.md#SceneNode-triggeredInteractions)
 and [`Artboard.incomingInteractions`](./scenegraph.md#Artboard-incomingInteractions).
 * * Which artboard the prototype experience begins on: [`homeArtboard`](#module_interactions-homeArtboard).
 * * Properties that affect Artboard scrolling behavior: Artboard [`viewportHeight`](./scenegraph.md#Artboard-viewportHeight) and
 node [`fixedWhenScrolling`](./scenegraph.md#SceneNode-fixedWhenScrolling).
 *
 * **Since**: XD 19
 *
 * @example ```javascript
 * // Get all interactions in the entire document (grouped by triggering node)
 var allInteractions = require("interactions").allInteractions;
 // Get interactions triggered by the selected node
 var nodeInteractions = selection.items[0].triggeredInteractions;
 // Get all interactions leading to a particular artboard
 var artboard = ...
 var interactionsToArtboard = artboard.incomingInteractions;
 // Print out details of one particular interaction
 var interaction = ...
 console.log("Trigger: " + interaction.trigger.type + " -> Action: " + interaction.action.type);
