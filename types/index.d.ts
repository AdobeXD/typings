     *
     * The selection can only contain items within the current edit context:
     *
     *  - If the user has drilled down into a container node, the container is the current edit context and only its immediate children can be selected.
     *  - If the user hasn’t drilled into any container, the root of the document is the edit context, and the selection may contain any artboard or any combination of the pasteboard’s immediate children and one or more artboards’ immediate children. The selection cannot contain both artboards and non-artboards at the same time, however.
     *
     * Note that when in the root edit context, the selection can contain items with multiple different parents.
     *
     * Items that are locked cannot be in the selection. If the user or your plugin attempts to select any locked items, they are automatically filtered into a separate list (itemsIncludingLocked) which is generally only used by the Unlock command.
